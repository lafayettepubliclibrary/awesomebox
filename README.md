Internet Connected, Self Tweeting Awesome Box
<br>
Checked out an item from the library and found it really awesome? Want to share with everyone else how awesome it is? Just scan the item's barcode and drop it in the awesomebox at the circ desk.  It will automatically tweet the title and online catalog link to a special Lafayette Public Library twitter account.
<br>
While there is an awesomebox webapp available at <a href="http://awesomebox.io">awesomebox.io</a>, I wanted to see if I could make a simple one that the public could scan and tweet about the item in real time when returning.
<br>
It will be built using a wireless connected raspberry pi and a usb barcode scanner. I'll be updating the code here as I make progress.
